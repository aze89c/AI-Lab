5b. Stemming and Lemmatization with NLTK 
What is Stemming? 
Stemming is a kind of normalization for words. It is a technique where a set of words in a sentence are converted 
into a sequence to shorten its lookup. The words which have the same meaning but have some variation 
according to the context or sentence are normalized. Stemming is hence a way to find the root word from 
variations of the word. 
NLTK provides many inbuilt stemmers such as the Porter Stemmer, Snowball Stemmer and Lancaster Stemmer.
