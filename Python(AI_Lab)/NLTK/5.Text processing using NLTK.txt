5.Text processing using NLTK 
 
Natural Language Processing or NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction 
between computers and humans using the natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, 
decipher, understand, and make sense of human languages in a manner that is valuable. To this end, many 
different models, libraries, and methods have been used to train machines to process text, understand it, 
make predictions based on it, and even generate new text. The first step to training a model is to obtain and 
preprocess the data. In this article, I will be going through some of the most common steps to be followed 
with almost any dataset before you can pass it as an input to a model. 
What is NLTK? 
The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic 
and statistical natural language processing for English written in the Python programming language. It 
consists of the most common algorithms such as tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, sentiment 
analysis, topic segmentation, and named entity recognition.
