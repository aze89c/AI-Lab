2. Tic-Tac-Toe: 
 
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses, is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid.  
The objective of the game is to achieve a winning pattern, traditionally three of the player's symbols in a  
row – either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally – before the opponent does. 
 
The game begins with an empty grid, and players take turns placing their symbols, typically "X" for one player  
and "O" for the other, in unoccupied cells. The simplicity of the game rules allows for quick and easy  
gameplay, making it accessible for players of all ages. 
 
Tic-Tac-Toe is often used as a teaching tool for basic game theory and strategy, as it involves critical thinking  
and foresight. Due to its straightforward nature, the game usually ends in a win for one player, a draw  
(often referred to as a "cat's game"), or sometimes an unfinished game if players fail to make optimal moves. 
 
While Tic-Tac-Toe may seem elementary, its enduring popularity lies in its ability to entertain and  
challenge players in a concise and easily understandable format. Whether played on paper, a physical board,  
or through digital platforms, Tic-Tac-Toe remains a timeless and fundamental game in the world of strategy  
and competition.
