 1. Text Classification: 
 
Text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves categorizing textual 
data into predefined classes or categories. It plays a pivotal role in organizing, managing, and extracting 
valuable insights from large volumes of unstructured text. The goal is to automatically assign a predefined 
label or category to a given piece of text based on its content. 
 
Machine learning algorithms, particularly supervised learning models, are commonly employed for text 
classification tasks. These models are trained on labeled datasets, where each text sample is associated with a 
corresponding category. Feature extraction techniques, such as bag-of-words or word embeddings, are 
utilized to represent the textual data in a format suitable for machine learning. 
 
Text classification finds applications in various domains, including spam detection in emails, sentiment 
analysis in social media, topic categorization in news articles, and customer feedback analysis. Its significance 
extends to automating document categorization, facilitating information retrieval, and enhancing overall data 
organization and management.
