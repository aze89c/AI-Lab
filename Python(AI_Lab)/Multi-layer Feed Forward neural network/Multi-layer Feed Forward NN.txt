4B. Multi-layer Feed Forward neural network 
 
An entrance point into sophisticated neural networks, where incoming data is routed through several 
layers of artificial neurons. Every node is linked to every neuron in the following layer, resulting in a 
fully connected neural network. There are input and output layers, as well as several hidden levels, for a 
total of at least three or more layers. It possesses bidirectional propagation, which means it can propagate 
both forward and backward.

  Inputs are multiplied by weights and supplied into the activation function, where they are adjusted to 
minimize loss during backpropagation. Weights are just machine-learned values from Neural Networks. 
They modify themselves based on the gap between projected and training outcomes. Softmax is used as an 
output layer activation function after nonlinear activation functions.
