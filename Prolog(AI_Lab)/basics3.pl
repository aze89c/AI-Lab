The warning you're seeing:

warning: discontiguous predicate likes/2 - clause ignored
means that you defined likes/2 in non-contiguous lines in your program ‚Äî i.e., Prolog encountered multiple clauses of the same predicate, but they were separated by other predicate definitions.

üîç What Does ‚ÄúDiscontiguous Predicate‚Äù Mean?
In Prolog, all clauses for the same predicate (like likes/2) should be grouped together. If they are not, GNU Prolog will:

Give a warning

And possibly ignore the later clauses

‚úÖ Example of Correct Usage (Grouped Together):


% Correct: all `likes/2` clauses are together
likes(ram, mango).
likes(bill, cindy).

girl(seema).
red(rose).
owns(john, gold).
‚ùå Example That Causes the Warning:

likes(ram, mango).

girl(seema).
red(rose).

likes(bill, cindy).  % <-- This will cause a "discontiguous predicate" warning

owns(john, gold).
üõ† How to Fix It
Move all likes/2 facts together, like this:


% PROGRAM

likes(ram, mango).
likes(bill, cindy).

girl(seema).
red(rose).
owns(john, gold).
Alternatively, you can suppress the warning (not recommended unless necessary) by adding this directive above your likes/2 definitions:


:- discontiguous likes/2.
But the best practice is to keep related facts and rules together to avoid confusion and errors.
